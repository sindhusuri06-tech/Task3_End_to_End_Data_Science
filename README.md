# Task 3 – End-to-End Data Science Project

## Project Title
Student Performance Prediction

## Objective
To predict student marks based on study hours using Machine Learning.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Flask

## Workflow
1. Data creation and preprocessing
2. Model training using Linear Regression
3. Model saving
4. API deployment using Flask

## API Usage
POST request to `/predict`
Example input:
{
  "study_hours": 6
}

## Output
Predicted marks based on study hours.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow from model building to deployment.
